# Go Learning Notes 

[ Terjemahkan ke Indonesia](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&tl=id&u=https://github.com/anovpad-code/Go-Core/blob/main/LEARNING.md)

Today I learned the basics of Go:

* **Package Main**: Every executable Go file must start with this.
* **Import "fmt"**: Used for formatting text and printing to the console.
* **Func Main**: The entry point where the program starts.
* **Variables**: Using `:=` for short variable declarations.
